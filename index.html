        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 26-year-old third-year computer science student. I would
          describe myself as a meticulous, creative, and calm individual. I
          enjoy tasks that require precision and independent work, and my
          strength lies in perseverance. However, I also greatly appreciate
          social activities and get along well with people of diverse
          backgrounds. Engaging in team sports during my free time and
          participating in group projects during my studies have provided
          valuable experience in teamwork and essential collaborative skills. I
          have been passionate about coding and pursuing a career in the field
          of computer science for a long time, and I am eagerly looking forward
          to gaining hands-on experience in my chosen field alongside my
          studies.
